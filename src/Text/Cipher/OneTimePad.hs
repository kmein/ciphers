-- | The One-Time Pad cipher is an idealised variant of the Vigen√®re cipher
-- implemented in "Text.Cipher.Vigenere". Once encrypted, it is impossible to crack
-- without the whole key. More details can be found in

-- | Given a generator with which to generate the random key and a plaintext,
-- returns the cipher text and the key it was encrypted with.
